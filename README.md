# Hey there.

My name is Zeh Fernando. I live in New York, NY, where I work for [Work & Co](http://work.co/) as a (hands on) Group Engineering Director.

I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. I grew up loving both to draw and to code, starting with a [TK-85](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TK_85) when I was 10 and then later being entertained by things like the [MSX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX), the [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe), [ANSI art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_art), and the [demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene).

I've been working as a programmer since 1994, initially developing database management systems and multimedia CD-ROMs, and later, design-driven interactive experiences for the Web, mobile applications, and out of home experiences. What I love doing is writing code to bring stuff to life on a screen.

I’ve also accidentally created and helped maintain several open-source projects. These include [MC Tween](http://hosted.zeh.com.br/mctween/) and [Tweener](https://code.google.com/archive/p/tweener/) (for ActionScript animation), [usfxr](https://github.com/zeh/usfxr) (for real-time audio effects synthesis in C#/Unity), and [others](https://github.com/zeh?tab=repositories).

Language wise, I tend to believe I’m mostly idiom-agnostic but today my attention is divided between JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Java, Objective C, Dart, and Rust, while targetting the web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

Here's where my language activity by time stands for the past 30 days, courtesy of [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/):
